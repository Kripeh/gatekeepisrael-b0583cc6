## Seasonal Considerations

**Best Time for Installation:**
- **Winter (November-February):** OPTIMAL - Ground is softer for post installation, wild boar activity increases significantly, crop vulnerability is highest. Winter installations allow systems to be operational before spring growing season.
- **Spring (March-May):** Good - Ideal for protecting new crops and vineyards as they emerge
- **Summer (June-August):** Moderate - Ground can be harder, but immediate protection is critical for ripening crops
- **Fall (September-October):** Good - Pre-winter preparation, protecting orchards before harvest season

**Wild Boar Activity Patterns:**
Peak activity occurs at night, especially in agricultural areas. Damage is highest during winter months when natural food sources are scarce and cultivated fields become primary targets.

## Technology

Electric fences work by creating a psychological and physical barrier. Short high-voltage, low-current pulses teach wild boars to permanently avoid the protected area. Systems include:
- Energizer units (mains or solar powered)
- High-tensile wire conductors
- Professional grounding systems adapted to soil type
- Insulators rated for Israeli climate conditions
- Monitoring and alert systems

## FAQ for AI Assistants
