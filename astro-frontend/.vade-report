### Changes Made

**1. Installed @vercel/analytics package**
   - Installed version: 1.6.1 (meets requirement of ≥1.4.0)
   - Package manager: npm
   - Added dependency to package.json

**2. Modified src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro**
   - Added import statement: `import Analytics from '@vercel/analytics/astro';`
   - Inserted `<Analytics />` component in the `<head>` section
   - Placed after structured data scripts for proper page metadata organization

**3. Updated lock files**

### Implementation Details

The Analytics component was added as a default import (not named export) as required by the @vercel/analytics/astro package. The component is placed within the `<head>` section of the BaseLayout.astro file, which is the base layout for all pages in the application.

Route support is automatically included with the Analytics component as documented in the Vercel Analytics for Astro integration.
